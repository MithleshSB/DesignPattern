/*   STRATEGY PATTERN
 * The Strategy Design Pattern is all about giving you choices for how something
 * should workâ€”and making it easy to switch between those choices.
 * Imagine giving different ways to select:
 *
 * without -> If parent class does not have some capability and child classes are driving their own
 * and suppose many child classes driving the same method/capability which will lead to the duplicate
 * in larger amounts.(Child having same code/functionality which base doesn't.)
 *
 * With -> created the basic interface and can implement any type of functionality we require
 * which will help in reusing the code rather duplicating.
 * So, if we ever want to add a new funtionality method we can implement the "blueprint"
 * without changing the main code.
